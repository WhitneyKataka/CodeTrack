            <p>
                Git, to me, feels like a <b>time machine for code</b>. It keeps track of every small or big change I
                make in my project, so I never truly lose work. A <b>repository</b> is like a project folder where all
                my code lives, and Git quietly records its history. Using <code>git status</code>, I can check which
                files are new or changed. Then, with <code>git add</code>, I move my changes into a ‚Äúbasket‚Äù (staging
                area) before making a permanent <b>commit</b>, which is like taking a snapshot of that moment in my
                project.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <b>commit history</b> (<code>git log</code>) is like a journal showing who changed what, when, and
                why. I also learned about <b>branching</b>, which is like creating a new path in a storybook ‚Äî I can
                try new features without disturbing the main storyline. Once it works, I use <b>merging</b> to bring my
                changes back into the main project safely. And GitHub? It‚Äôs like the cloud library where my repo lives,
                so I can share it with teammates and collaborate without losing track of changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                ‚ú¶ <b>Debugging as a DevOps/Cloud Engineer:</b> I realized Git is not just about saving code ‚Äî it helps
                me solve real-world issues. For example, if an application suddenly stops connecting to its database,
                instead of guessing, I can check the <code>git log</code> to see if someone recently updated the
                configuration file. This way, I know exactly <i>who changed what</i> and <i>when</i>, making it easier
                to fix problems quickly. That‚Äôs powerful ‚Äî it means Git is not just a tool for developers, but a
                lifeline for engineers like me who need to keep systems running.
            </p>

            <p>
                ‚ú¶ The biggest lesson for me is that Git gives me <b>confidence</b>. Even though I am new to DevOps and
                have no IT background, I don‚Äôt feel lost anymore. Every commit, branch, and merge I make is part of a
                bigger journey ‚Äî learning to work smarter, collaborate better, and grow into a cloud engineer who can
                both build and troubleshoot with clarity.
